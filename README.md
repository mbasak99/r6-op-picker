# Why this was made
My friends and I like to play Rainbow 6 Siege most nights we have free, and sometimes we're tired of playing super tactically in Ranked. So instead we switch it up and play Unranked/Quick Match and just play random operators. I wanted to make a tool that makes it easy for us to randomly choose an operator so we can focus on goofing around against the enemy team.
